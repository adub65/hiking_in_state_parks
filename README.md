# README
Welcome to the Hiking In PA state parks app. The purpose of the app is to keep track of all the hikes a user does across the state. This app was created using Ruby 2.5.0. To get started, fork and clone this repo. In your terminal, run `bundle install` to get all the proper gems. All of the test suites can be ran using `rspec`.

To launch the app, type `rails s` in the terminal. Once a rails server is running, go to a browser. Type "localhost:3000" to launch the app's signin page. When either logged in or sign up is complete, the app will display a profile page.

From the user's profile page, click on `See All Parks` to view all the state parks that have been hiked in so far. From this State Park page, either click on a park or create a new one.

When a park is either created or clicked on, the user can then view the trials at that park or create a new trail. The next screen prompts to create a hike on that trail. A hike consists of the amount of time hike on the trail and the date.
